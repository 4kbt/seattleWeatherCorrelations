One night, coming home from the mountains in a cool, wet winter, I casually
mentioned to Susan that "next month will probably be warm, because
we'll regress to the mean". She disagreed, and so I did an analysis like this 
one. I'll let you figure out who was more correct.

These are data from SeaTac Airport from 1948-present. The data were originally
in CSV format (I've appended it, and the unix script I used to parse it, in case
you're curious). I've tab-delimited the relevant columns and provided an import
Octave script to get things started.

Questions:

1. How much does the temperature (relative to average) in a given month 
correlate with the temperature (relative to average) in the following month? 
3 months out? 6 months out? A year out?  Quantify the uncertainties.

2. How much does the precipitation (relative to average) in a given month 
correlate with the precipitation (relative to average) in the following month?
3 months out? 6 months out? A year out?  Quantify the uncertainties.
